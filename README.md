# Brandeis Buy Nothing

"Brandeis Buy Nothing" is a community-driven React Native mobile app under development designed to foster sustainability and reduce waste on campus. Inspired by the global Buy Nothing Project, our app empowers Brandeis University students, faculty, and staff to give away items they no longer need and find free items they do. Whether it's textbooks, furniture, electronics, or clothing, users can easily post listings and connect with others in the community who are interested in repurposing these items.

# Key Features:

### 1. Free Exchange
Browse and post listings for items available for free within the Brandeis community.

### 2. Messaging
Communicate directly with other users from Brandeis to arrange pickups or drop-offs.

### 3. Community Building
Promote sustainability and foster connections between members of the Brandeis community.
